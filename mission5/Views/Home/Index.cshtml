        <h2>Welcome to My Poetry Journey</h2>
        <p>Learning French poetry has opened my eyes to the beauty and depth of life. Through poetic verses, I discover a whole new world of emotions, imagery, and meaning. The French language, with its flowery expressions, inspires a sense of romance, serenity, and a deeper understanding of human experiences.</p>
